        \item[] {\color{blue}INITIAL CLAIM}
        \item[Q.] {What news report (or video which is less than 5 minutes) will this investigation focus on? (
              Provide citation and reference support.)}
        \item Mobile phone electromagnetic waves may incur physical and mental health risks (\cite{AIA970701}). % TODO: {\color{gray} One declarative sentence answer}
              \begin{enumerate}[A.]
                  \item [Q.] What is the {\color{blue}initial claim} presented in this article or video?
                  \item Electromagnetic waves that cell phones produce and use increase the chance of a person developing
                        cancer in their body.
                        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
                            \item[Q.] What is \underline{one premise} that supports the {\color{blue}initial claim}?
                            \item Electromagnetic waves from mobile phones can affect the human body.
                                  \begin{enumerate}[a.]
                                      \item [Q.] What \underline{evidence} supports the \underline{premise}?
                                      \item As of 2005 the WHO recommended that claims of EHS be evaluated to determine if
                                            a person claiming to be affected by EHS has a medical condition that may be causing
                                            the symptoms the person is attributing to EHS, to determine if the person has a
                                            psychological condition, and to assess the person's environment for issues like air
                                            or noise pollution that may be causing problems (\cite{36069}).
                                      \item The short-term effect of electromagnetic waves of CDMA mobile phones on the meridian (\cite{R9631008}).
                                  \end{enumerate}
                            \item [Q.] What is \underline{another premise} that supports the {\color{blue}initial claim}?
                            \item Electromagnetic waves can increase cancer risk.
                                  \begin{enumerate}[a.]
                                      \item [Q.] What \underline{evidence} supports the \underline{premise}?
                                      \item Israeli scientists pointed out that people who use mobile phones every day for
                                            several hours have a 50\% higher chance of developing parotid gland cancer than
                                            those who don't use mobile phones at all (\cite{epaper9706,10.1093/aje/kwm325}).
                                      \item They investigated if there was an increased risk of leukemia with mobile phone use (\cite{16094}).
