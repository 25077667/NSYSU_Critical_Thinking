            \item[Q.] {What news report (or video which is less than 5 minutes) will this investigation focus on? (
                  Provide citation and reference support.)}
            \item Mobile phone electromagnetic waves may incur physical and mental health risks \parencite{AIA970701}. % TODO: {\color{gray} One declarative sentence answer}

                        \item [Q.] What is the {\color{blue}initial claim} presented in this article or video?
                        \item Electromagnetic waves that cell phones produce and use increase the chance of a person developing
                              cancer in their body.
                              \begin{enumerate}[1.]

                                    \item Electromagnetic waves from mobile phones can affect the human body.

                                                \item In 2006, the World Health Organization released a new
                                                      disease called "Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity" that may
                                                      affect the human central nervous system, immune system,
                                                      cardiovascular, reproductive system, visual system \parencite{36069}.
                                                \item According to the report of Yan of National Yi-Lan University,
                                                      the participant who uses a mobile phone for a long time will
                                                      experience more symptoms of physical discomfort,
                                                      including dizziness, weariness, and headache \parencite{R9631008}.

                                    \item Electromagnetic waves can increase cancer risk.

                                                \item Israeli scientists pointed out that people who use mobile
                                                      phones every day for several hours have a 50\% higher chance
                                                      of developing parotid gland cancer than
                                                      those who don't use mobile phones at all \parencite{epaper9706,10.1093/aje/kwm325}.
                                                \item According to a book called “Electromagnetic Waves and
                                                      Human Health”, it mentioned there is an association
                                                      between electromagnetic waves and childhood leukemia
                                                      which is cancer of the body's blood-forming issues \parencite{16094}.

                                    \item According to the information, we find that electromagnetic wave
                                          from cell phones produces could affect different body systems and
                                          increase the risk of cancer. % TODO: {\color{gray} One declarative sentence answer}
